Create an architecture design from a local PRD file at {path}.
Follow the recommendations of the Google Cloud Well-Architected Framework (https://docs.cloud.google.com/architecture/framework?hl=fr).
If relevant data is missing from the PRD, you should highlight them and ask the probing questions.
Whenever possible, please produce one or several mermaid.live compatible diagram highlighting the different architecture decisions
in terms of services, data layer, but also network flows between the different components. Use sequence diagrams to highlight the
time-based processes that need to be implemented.
"""
description = """
Kicks off the architecture design process by reading a local Product Requirements Document (PRD) file.

This is useful when the PRD is stored in a Git repository and has been pulled locally.
The expected output is a detailed architecture document. See 'examples/architecture-design.md' for a complete example.
