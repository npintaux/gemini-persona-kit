# Gemini CLI Custom Commands for a Product Owner
# In: ~/.gemini/extensions/po/commands/jira/create-story.toml
# Invoked via: /jira:create-story

# Command to create a new User Story in Jira.
prompt = '''As a Product Owner, I want to create a new User Story in Jira.
The tool should:
1. Create a new 'Story' issue in Jira.
2. Allow specifying the parent 'Epic' if applicable.
'''
request = "Please provide the Jira Project Key, the Story summary, and optionally the parent Epic Key."
# This would trigger a tool that reads the markdown file, parses the epics and stories,
# and then uses the Jira API (e.g., createJiraIssue tool) to create the issues.
