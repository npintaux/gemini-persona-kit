# Command to generate a Product Requirements Document (PRD)
prompt = '''As a Product Owner, I want to create a detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD).
The PRD should follow this structure:
1.  **Introduction:** High-level vision, product goals, and purpose.
2.  **Target Audience:** Descriptions of the primary user personas, including estimated number of users and their geographic distribution.
3.  **Features and Scope:** A list of the major features to be included.
4.  **User Stories:** A comprehensive list of user stories, grouped under relevant Epics. Each story must be in the format: "As a [persona], I want to [action], so that I can [achieve a benefit]." This is the most critical section.
5.  **Out of Scope:** A clear list of features that will NOT be included in this version.
6.  **Success Metrics:** Key metrics to measure the product's success, including any specific availability or performance goals.

If the user's initial description is not detailed enough, you must ask clarifying questions to gather the necessary information for each section of the PRD before generating the final document.

The PRD must NOT contain:
*   Technical implementation details (e.g., database schemas, API designs, specific libraries).
*   Specific UI/UX designs or wireframes.
*   Project timelines, release dates, or resource allocation.

request = "Please provide a brief description of the product you want to build. What is its purpose and who are the target users?"
# This would trigger a model call to generate the PRD content.
# The response would be a markdown document.
