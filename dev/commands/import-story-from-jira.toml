# Gemini CLI Custom Commands for a Developer
# In: ~/.gemini/extensions/dev/commands/import-story-from-jira.toml
# Invoked via: /import-story-from-jira

# Command to import a User Story from Jira.
prompt = '''As a Developer, I want to import a User Story from Jira into my local environment to begin implementation.
The tool should:
1. Fetch the details of the specified Jira issue (which should be a 'Story').
2. Display the story's summary, description, and acceptance criteria in a clear format.
3. Create a new feature branch named after the Jira issue key (e.g., 'feature/PROJ-123').
'''
request = "Please provide the Jira Issue Key for the story you want to import (e.g., 'PROJ-123')."
# This would trigger a tool that uses the Jira API (e.g., getJiraIssue tool) to fetch the issue details
# and then uses a local git tool to create a new branch.
